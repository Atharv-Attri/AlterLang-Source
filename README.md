### *INSERT BADGES HERE*

### TL;DR
Alter is a programming language that is for those new to programming, with its main feature being allowing the programmer to code in a English-like syntax, or programming syntax, or both at the same time!

To learn how to use the language, please skip down to How to Install

### Why Alter was made (And what's up with the name?)
Alter is made so that anyone can learn to code. If it's your first time learning to code, Alter is the language to 
start with. Alter got it's name because learning to code is a life-altering decision, yet many people miss out on it. A majority of people don't start because when people think of programming today, the general thought tends to be something complicated like:

```C
include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int a=1
    if (0<a) {
        printf("Hi!")
    }
} 
```
But we thought, Why? Why does learning to code have to be so complicated? 
Here is the same code in Alter's english-like syntax:
```
a=1
if 3 less_than .a ->
say "Hi!"
<-
```
#### *With Alter, Write Right.*

### What Is Alter
Alter is designed to be a middle path between the block programming that is often taught to beginners who are new to the art of programming, and the modern programming languages that are used in the workplace. Our language is designed to be as simple as possible so people who can write in English can write in Alter. As our users begin to get more acclimated with actually typing out code, they can transition from English syntax to code that resembles what is used today in the world, at their own pace.
### How to Install
For now, the easiest way to use Alter is with the our REPL on (REPL.it)[https://repl.it/@AlterLang/AlterLang-Source]
However, you can also download main.py and complier.py, and run main.py. 

### More information
Alter is still in it's Alpha Version, and has many bugs, we are working to fix these. 

Documentation coming soon!
