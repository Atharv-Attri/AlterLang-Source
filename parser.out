Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . say
    (1) say -> . SAY QUOTE TEXT QUOTE
    (2) say -> . SAY SPACE TEXT

    SAY             shift and go to state 2

    say                            shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> say .



state 2

    (1) say -> SAY . QUOTE TEXT QUOTE
    (2) say -> SAY . SPACE TEXT

    QUOTE           shift and go to state 3
    SPACE           shift and go to state 4


state 3

    TEXT            shift and go to state 6


state 5

    (1) say -> SAY QUOTE TEXT . QUOTE

    QUOTE           shift and go to state 7


state 6
